## Often, we want to return more than one value from a class method. Prior to the introduction of tuples in .NET, there were three common ways to do so. 
1. Out parameters
2. Class or struct types
3. Anonymous types returned through a dynamic return type 

## Tuples solve this problem. Tuples arenâ€™t new to C# or .NET. Tuples were first introduced as a part of .NET Framework 4.0.
 
## A C# tuple is a data structure that provides an easy way to represent a single set of data. The System.Tuple class provides static methods to create tuple objects.
 
## Tuples allow us to, 
1. Create, access, and manipulate a data set 
2. Return a data set from a method without using out parameter
3. Pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter
